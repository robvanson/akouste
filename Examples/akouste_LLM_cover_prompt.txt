# A **structured summary** of **akoúste markdown files**

akoúste markdown files define perceptual and listening experiments using the CommonMark specification with extensions for stimuli and responses.

## Instruction

Do **not** add comments or hints beyond the specified format.

## Structure

- Cover Page: Starts with `[//coverpage]: # "Start of coverpage" and ends with [//coverpage]: # "End of coverpage"`
- Experiment Page: Main content with stimuli and questions. Include `## {{{!answerstogo!|font-weight:bold}}} answers to go`
- Settings Block: Internal parameters using `[//label]: # "key:value"`
- Stimulus Table Block: Starts with `[//comment]: # "These are stimuli for this experiment", followed by [//stimulusX]: # "values"`

### Special Constructs

#### Stimuli

- Audio: `[[[Button Text | ColumnName{style}]]]`
- Video: `[[§ alt-text | ColumnName{width:30%;height:auto;} §]]`
- Image: `{{{§ ColumnName | style §}}}`
- Text: `{{{ColumnName | style }}}`

#### Responses

- Likert/Radio: `(())`
- VAS slider: `>>----------<<` inside a markdown table
- Text input: `<<| text {style} |>>`
- Keystroke: `@@@ text [keys] {style} @@@`

## Settings & Parameters

Settings and parameters are stored at the bottom,of the markdown, eg.:

- `[//parameter]: # "body.style: font-family: Arial;background-color:GhostWhite;"`
- `[//parameter]: # "addDigest:false"`

## Key Rules

- Preserve HTML tags and JavaScript as-is.
- Preserve >>, <<, <<|, and |>> character combinations as-is.
- Keep empty lines around headers, tables, and paragraph-level HTML tags.
- Follow strict formatting for cover page, settings, and stimulus table.

# Example

Here follows a relevant example:

```markdown

[//comment]: # "Use the 'Start of coverpage' - 'End of coverpage' comments to insert a coverpage"


[//coverpage]: # "Start of coverpage"

<center>

# The Cover Page

</center>

A cover page is optional, but often useful. A cover page is generally used to explain the aim and procedure of the experiment, and how to save and convey the results after completion of the experiment.

It is adviseable to include a sound sample to check the sound quality and level. 

### If you continue by clicking *Next*, this web page will  <span style="color:red;">store your responses</span> locally in this browser on this device. 

This information will remain stored in your browser until you erase it by clicking **Restart** after completing the experiment and saving the results. You can remove this information at any time by erasing the relevant history of your browser.

[//coverpage]: # "End of coverpage"

<center>

# Title of this page

### A table setup to position three *audio play buttons* representing columns *A*, *B* and *X* in the stimulus table.

|     |         |         |         |     |
| ---:| -------:|:-------:|:------- |:--- |
|     | [[[Label A \| A]]] |         | [[[Label B \| B]]] |     |
|     |         | [[[Label X \| X]]] |         |     |

</center>

Here can be put any general information about the stimuli.

<center>

[//comment]: // "Start of No Change"

## {{{!answerstogo!|font-weight:bold}}} answers to go

[//comment]: // "End of No Change"

</center>

---------------------------

Here you can put the text which tells the subjects what they are supposed to do.

---------------------------

<center>

### Question text. Which sound is most like the *Label X* sound?

|     |      |      |     |
| ---:|:----:|:----:|:--- |
|     | (()) | (()) |     |
|     | A    | B    |     |

### Question text. How well does Sound *Label X* resemble the chosen *Label A* or *LabelB* sound?

|            |      |      |      |      |      |           |
| ----------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:--------- |
| Not at all | (()) | (()) | (()) | (()) | (()) | Very Much |
| 1          |      |      | 3    |      |      | 5         |

### And you can also request text input from the user with a &lt;&lt;\| text {style} \|&gt;&gt; construct

What do you think?  <<|  your opinion here {width:5cm;color:gray;text-align:center} |>>

# Further instructions

In all transformations and translations:

- Markdown tables should have a header line and a line with the text alignments
- Add empty lines around paragraph level content, eg., headers, tables, paragraphs, HTML-blocks
- Add empty lines around lines with opening or closing **center** or **div** HTML-tags
- Lines containing ${"`"}[//comment]: # ${"`"}, followed by text on the same line should be used verbatim and never be translated
- Keep empty lines like they are present in the example
- Do **NOT** include a cover page when it is not in the example
- akoúste markdown output **must** be given in a code block

# Create a new akoúste experiment markdown 

- Target language: German.
- Create an akoúste markdown file in the target language presenting an ABX experiment where you label the stimuli 'Left', 'Right', 'Which', (Label A, Label B, Label X) respectively, with three questions:
    1. Ask the subject which of the speech sounds 'Left' or 'Right' is most like the stimulus sound 'Which' using two radio buttons labelled 'Left' and 'Right'. 
    2. Ask the subject to judge the intelligibility of the X stimulus on a 5 point Likert scale of radio buttons, from very unintelligible to very intelligible.
    3. Ask the subject to judge the pleasantness of the X stimulus on a visual analogue scale (VAS), from very unpleasant to very pleasant.
